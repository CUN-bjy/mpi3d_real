# mpi3d_real
This repository is a _unofficial_ backup service for `MPI3D-Real` dataset, which is provided in this paper: [**On the Transfer of Inductive Bias from Simulation to the Real World: a New Disentanglement Dataset**](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/d97d404b6119214e4a7018391195240a-Abstract.html). The dataset contains images of real objects with varying factors of variation, such as shape, color, texture and pose. The dataset is useful for studying the generalization and disentanglement abilities of representation learning models. The backup service allows users to download the dataset from a mirror site in case the original source is unavailable.

For more detailed information on the dataset, please check the [original repository](https://github.com/rr-learning/disentanglement_dataset)
